***************************************************************
Map standard and custom exceptions to http response bodies containing problem details as specified in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807[RFC-7807] and/or convert and throw problem details as exceptions. Both for JAX-RS as well as Spring Boot.
***************************************************************

== Server Side Examples

On the server side, include a dependency on `com.github.t1:problem-details-api` and a runtime dependency on `com.github.t1:problem-details-ri` for JAX-RS applications and `com.github.t1:problem-details-ri-spring` for Spring applications. Then you can simply throw an exception, and things will just work with defaults. Use annotations on the exception to use custom values.

=== Default Mapping

To produce a problem detail body, simply throw a standard exception, e.g. in JAX-RS:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------
throw new NotFoundException("There is no article [" + articleId + "]");
---------------------------------------------------------------

In Spring, you do:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------
throw HttpClientErrorException.create("There is no article [" + articleId + "]",
    NOT_FOUND, NOT_FOUND.getReasonPhrase(), null, null, null);
---------------------------------------------------------------

Both will result in an exception body similar to this:

[source,yaml]
---------------------------------------------------------------
{
  "type": "urn:problem-type:not-found",                       # <1>
  "title": "Not Found",                                       # <2>
  "status": 404,                                              # <3>
  "detail": "There is no article [862353]",                   # <4>
  "instance": "urn:uuid:d294b32b-9dda-4292-b51f-35f65b4bf64d" # <5>
}
---------------------------------------------------------------

<1> The default `type` is a URN derived from the type name of the exception by converting camel case to kebap case and stripping the `Exception`.
<2> The default `title` is derived from the type name of the exception by converting camel case to separate words.
<3> The default `status` is `500` except for an `IllegalArgumentException`, which gets mapped to 400, and the standard http exceptions (JAX-RS: `WebApplicationException`; Spring `HttpClientErrorException`), which get mapped to their corresponding status codes.
<4> The default `detail` is the message of the exception. There won't be a `detail` field, if the message of the exception is null.
<5> The default `instance` is a random UUID URN.

If the first requested type (in an `Accept` header) is `application/xml`, the body will be the xml equivalent of this json document.

=== Default Logging

The main use of the `instance` field is to have a reference to search for in the logs. So an appropriate log event is produced whenever the problem detail is created. Then you can see all the logs that led to the problem and other details, such as the stack trace. The stack trace is explicitly _never_ part of the body, as it must be considered sensitive information.

The logging category defaults to the fully qualified class name of the exception. By default, 4xx status codes are considered a problem of the client and are logged at `DEBUG` log level; 5xx status codes are a problem of the service, so they are logged at `ERROR`. As the stack trace is only relevant for server problems, it's only logged at `ERROR` and `WARNING` levels, not at `INFO` or `DEBUG` (see below for how to log at those levels).

http://www.slf4j.org[slf4j] is used for the logging. If this is not provided by your application server, you may also have to package the `slf4j-api` and a binding like `slf4j-jdk14`.

=== Annotations

Each of the defaults above can optionally be overridden with annotations. Additionally, custom problem detail fields (called extensions) can be defined with `@Extension` annotated fields or methods. E.g.:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------
@Type("https://example.com/probs/out-of-credit")
@Title("You do not have enough credit.")
@Status(FORBIDDEN) // <1>
@Logging(at = WARNING, to = "warnings") // <2>
@Getter @AllArgsConstructor @NoArgsConstructor(force = true) // <3>
public class OutOfCreditException extends RuntimeException {
    @Instance private URI instance; // <4>
    @Extension private int balance; // <5>
    private int cost; // <6>
    @Extension private List<URI> accounts; // <7>

    @Detail public String getDetail() { // <8>
        return "Your current balance is " + balance + ", but that costs " + cost + ".";
    }
}
---------------------------------------------------------------

<1> The status is a constant from the `javax.ws.rs.core.Response.Status` enum. This works also for Spring applications.
<2> The `@Logging` annotation defines the log level and the category. Can also be on the package (i.e. in the `package-info.java` file) to be a fallback for all exceptions in the package.
<3> These are https://projectlombok.org[Lombok] annotations, just for demo purposes; feel free to write the boiler plate code by hand ;-)
<4> The `@Instance` annotation can be on a field or a no-arg method.
<5> There can be multiple `@Extension` annotations on fields or no-arg methods.
<6> This field is not annotated, so it won't be part of the body.
<7> Extensions can also be complex types, i.e. arrays/lists or maps/objects containing multiple fields, as long as they are (de)serializable.
<8> The `@Detail` annotation can be on a field or a no-arg method.

This will result in an problem detail body like this:

[source,json]
---------------------------------------------------------------
{
  "type": "https://example.com/probs/out-of-credit",
  "title": "Forbidden",
  "status": 403,
  "detail": "Your current balance is 30, but that costs 50.",
  "instance": "urn:uuid:d294b32b-9dda-4292-b51f-35f65b4bf64d",
  "balance": 50,
  "accounts": [
    "/account/12345",
    "/account/67890"
  ]
}
---------------------------------------------------------------

=== Validations

One of the most common use-cases for Bad Requests is a failing validation. You can do a verification and throw a corresponding problem detail exception simply by calling `ValidationFailedException.validate(object)`.

The Spring Boot RI currently also converts the exception thrown when a parameter to a REST boundary method is annotated as `@Valid`. The JAX-RS RI currently can't due to technical restrictions.

== Client Side Examples

On the client side, a type-safe exception is thrown for your code to catch.

=== JAX-RS

The ideal JAX-RS client code would look like this:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------
class OrderGateway {
    public Shipment order(String articleId) {
        try {
            return target() // returns a configured `WebTarget`
                .path("/orders").request(APPLICATION_JSON_TYPE)
                .post(Entity.form(new Form().param("article", article)));
        } catch (OutOfCreditException e) {
            displayOutOfCredit(e.getBalance());
            return null;
        }
    }
}
---------------------------------------------------------------

The current RI is based on a JAX-RS `ClientResponseFilter` which brings some boiler plate code: it requires you to register the `OutOfCreditException` and the `ProblemDetailHandler`. And you have to unwrap the JAX-RS `ResponseProcessingException` before you can catch the `OutOfCreditException` (see the `ri` README for details).

Other implementations may have other requirements and limitations.

=== MicroProfile REST Client

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------
class OrderGateway {
    static {
        ProblemDetailExceptionRegistry.register(OutOfCreditException.class);
    }

    private OrderApi api = RestClientBuilder.newBuilder()
        .baseUri("http://...")
        .register(ProblemDetailResponseExceptionMapper.class)
        .build(OrderApi.class);

    public Shipment order(String articleId) {
        try {
            return api.order(1, article);
        } catch (OutOfCreditException e) {
            displayOutOfCredit(e.getBalance());
            return null;
        }
    }
}
---------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the registration of the `OutOfCreditException` in the `ProblemDetailExceptionRegistry` and the `ProblemDetailResponseExceptionMapper` in the `RestClientBuilder` is specific to the Spring Boot RI. Other implementations may have other requirements and limitations.

=== Spring Boot

In Spring, a client could look like this:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------
class OrderGateway {
    static {
        ProblemDetailExceptionRegistry.register(OutOfCreditException.class);
    }

    public Shipment order(String articleId) {
        try {
            RestTemplate template = new RestTemplate();
            template.setErrorHandler(new ProblemDetailErrorHandler());
            return template.postForObject(BASE_URI + "/orders", form, Shipment.class);
        } catch (OutOfCreditException e) {
            displayOutOfCredit(e.getBalance());
            return null;
        }
    }
}
---------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the registration of the `OutOfCreditException` in the `ProblemDetailExceptionRegistry` and the `ProblemDetailErrorHandler` in the `RestTemplate` is specific to the Spring Boot RI. Other implementations may have other requirements and limitations.

== Module Structure

=== API

This is the API your application can depend on while the implementations can vary. It contains the annotations, an enum `LogLevel` for the `@Logging` annotation, and a `Constants` class containing `PROBLEM_DETAIL_JSON` and `PROBLEM_DETAIL_XML`, and their typed equivalents for JAX-RS `MediaType`.

On the server side, the binding happens without any application code dependencies, e.g. by an `ExceptionMapper`, a `ControllerAdvice`, or whatever mechanism is necessary for the implementation.

On the client side, some manual registration (e.g. of a `ClientResponseFilter` or a `ResponseErrorHandler` and the exceptions to be mapped to) may be necessary, but this will not be portable, as the mechanism to do this registration is specific to the http client api you use. Some implementations may even work without such a manual step.

=== Dummy-Impl [ri]

A JAX-RS implementation, called `ri` even though it's actually only a POC, and it's incomplete. See the README for details.

=== ri-spring

A Spring Boot implementation. This also is just a POC, there may be better integration points that I'm not aware of.

=== ri-lib

This is a library used by the JAX-RS RI as well as the Spring RI. It's not part of any supported public API, so you MUST NOT depend on this module directly.

=== Test (JAX-RS)

Builds a `war` hard-wired to the `ri`; and when using the maven profile `with-slf4j`, the `slf4j-api` and `slf4j-jdk14` are included as well. The integration tests use https://github.com/t1/jee-testcontainers[JEE Testcontainers], i.e. it can be configured to start different Docker containers with various JEE application servers (details below). By default, it starts a Wildfly.

You can also specify a base URL in the system property `testcontainer-running` (e.g. `-Dtestcontainer-running=http://localhost:8080/problem-details-test`), so the tests verify a running service. This is very handy while developing the implementation. This also works when the running service is the Spring Boot Test application (see below).

==== Wildfly

Default `mvn` or explicitly `mvn -Djee-testcontainer=wildfly`

==== Open Liberty

`mvn -Djee-testcontainer=open-liberty:19.0.0.9-javaee8-java11 -Pwith-slf4j`

Needs the tag for jdk11 support. Needs dependencies on `slf4j-api` and `slf4j-jdk14`.

==== TomEE

`mvn -Djee-testcontainer=tomee`

3 tests fail, because this version of TomEE (9.0.20 / 8.0.0-M3) doesn't write the problem detail response entity in some cases for some reason:
StandardExceptionMappingIT.shouldMapWebApplicationExceptionWithoutEntityButMessage
StandardExceptionMappingIT.shouldMapWebApplicationExceptionWithoutEntityOrMessage
ValidationFailedExceptionMappingIT.shouldMapValidationFailedException

==== Payara

`mvn -Djee-testcontainer=payara -Pwith-slf4j`

Currently fails due to lack of jdk11 support of the https://hub.docker.com/r/payara/server-full[`payara`] image. Needs dependencies on `slf4j-api` and `slf4j-jdk14`.

=== test-spring

Builds a Spring Boot application containing the RI. The integration tests also start the application.

You can specify a base URL in the system property `testcontainer-running` (e.g. `-Dtestcontainer-running=http://localhost:8080`), so the tests verify a running service. This is very handy while developing the implementation. This also works when the running service is the JAX-RS Test application (see above).
